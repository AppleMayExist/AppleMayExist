# Hello!
If you *didn't* happen to stumble across my profile and actually want to see my
work, you should visit my [Forgejo instance](https://git.amesite.me/daniel).
This account is mainly for contributing to FOSS projects that don't allow the
use of a more ethical forge, and some apps that require GitHub to sign in.

Please, if you maintain a FOSS project, consider mirroring or completely
switching to either a self-hosted forge like [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/)
or [sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/), or a hosted forge at
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) or [sr.ht](https://sr.ht/). For more
information about switching away from GitHub, please make a visit to the
[Software Freedom Conservancy's page](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/)
on the topic.
